# ProDev Mobile App 0x00

## Project Setup

This project was created using Expo with the Expo Router template.
The scaffolding was generated using:

npx create-expo-app@latest

The project uses TypeScript and file-based routing.

## Running the App

The development server was started using:

npx expo start --offline

The application was tested on a physical device using the Expo Go app.

## Reset Project Observation

Running the reset command:

npm run reset-project

removed the default example screens, reset the routing structure,
and provided a clean starting point for development.

## Platform Notes
Since this project was developed on Windows, iOS simulator commands
such as `npm run ios` were not supported. The application was successfully
tested using Expo Go.
